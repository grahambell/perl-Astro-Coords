Astro::Coords
=============

A wrapper class around Astro::SLA that simplifies the handling of
astronomical coordinate systems. It can be used to convert between
J2000, B1950, Galactic and super Galactic coordinates.  It can
calculate the azimuth and elevation of a source specified in
equatorial coordinates, orbital elements or by name (if a planet).
It can also determine whether the specified coordinates are observable
for the given telescope.

In addition to Astro::Coords, a class for handling telescope
parameters (altitude, longitude and latitude) is also provided
(Astro::Telescope).

Requirements
------------

This class uses Astro::SLA and Time::Object.


Building
--------

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The test calculates the azimuth and elevation of two sources (one a
planet, the other an object in equatorial coordinates).

Changes
-------

 v0.01 - initial test release to CPAN

 v0.02 - Add Astro::Coords::Calibration and Astro::Coords::Fixed

 v0.03 - Add isObservable method
         Astro::Telescope now knows telescope limits (although
         only for JCMT and UKIRT)
