Astro::Coords
=============

A wrapper class around Astro::SLA that simplifies the handling of
astronomical coordinate systems. It can be used to convert between
J2000, B1950, Galactic and super Galactic coordinates.  It can
calculate the azimuth and elevation of a source specified in
equatorial coordinates, orbital elements or by name (if a planet).

In addition to Astro::Coords, a class for handling telescope
parameters (altitude, longitude and latitude) is also provided
(Astro::Telescope).

Requirements
------------

This class uses Astro::SLA and Time::Object.


Building
--------

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

The test calculates the azimuth and elevation of two sources (one a
planet, the other an object in equatorial coordinates).
